# Digital-Image-Processing
This repository contains various tasks and implementations from my Digital Image Processing (DIP) lab. It includes image transformations, filtering techniques, edge detection, morphological operations, and other essential DIP concepts. Each task is documented with code and explanations.
1. Added parking lot image processing tasks: grayscale conversion, cropping, white space analysis, and bounding box drawing.

2. Added image processing tasks for traffic sign detection, satellite imaging, and smart surveillance with preprocessing and segmentation steps

3. Added image enhancement tasks for medical scans, license plates, satellite images, and old manuscripts

4.
